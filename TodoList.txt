Todo List
X NOP UI code when UI hidden, Restore when unhidden
X Read values from .ini file
X Interpret .ini provided staticCam offsets as view aligned axis
X Set staticCam position for selected sim age
- Only set staticCam position when BodyShop updates it, get values from BodyShop and apply offsets
- Possibly manually handle switch between freeCam and staticCam to stop flashing screen
- Find morph value, where is it set, can it be hacked to load pregMorph?
